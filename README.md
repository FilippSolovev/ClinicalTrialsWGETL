# Clinical trial data conventions for the OMOP Common Data Model

The goal of this repository is to apply Clinical trial data conventions to the 'real' data.
As the first try, the PhUSE dataset has been chosen. It is a CDISC-compliant synthetic SDTM dataset.

For more information about the Clinical trials conventions, please visit our [wiki](https://github.com/OHDSI/ClinicalTrialsWGETL/wiki) or download [pdf](docs/omop_clinical_trials_data_conventions_v1.0_July_2020.pdf) version.
